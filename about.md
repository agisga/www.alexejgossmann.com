Hi, my name is Alexej Gossmann.
I'm professionally interested in machine learning / AI, statistics, mathematics, software development in those areas, medical applications of the above.

I ~~used to (?)~~ keep a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">blog</a> to practice writing fast.

**_0-fold Cross-Validation_** is the name of this <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">blog</a>.
All opinions are mine, obviously.

**2021, 2022 Update:** Unfortunately, I have been updating this blog very infrequently after finishing my PhD studies in 2018 (just two new posts in over 4 years). Despite the novel typing technique (demonstrated below), having kids and a real job has reduced my blog post output very substantially. But I will do my best to post occasionally as I still have many ideas and a couple drafts for new articles on this blog.
