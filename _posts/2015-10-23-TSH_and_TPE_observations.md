I spent much of the last two months reading Lehmann & Romano "Testing Statistical Hypotheses" (3rd ed.) and Lehmann & Casella "Theory of Point Estimation" (2nd ed.), abbr. TSH and TPE. The following is a collection of ~~random facts~~ observations I made while reading TSH and TPE. The choice of topics is biased towards application in regression models.
